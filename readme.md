# cubvm

a spritual successor to [tetrvm](https://github.com/boonsboos/tetrvm) which stores data in Rubik's Cubes.

how do you modify values? you have to twist and rotate the cube!

also there's a 3d stack which you can move

planned:
- assembly dialect
- interactive virtual cube
- graphics (backburner)

```

R U R' U' ;
